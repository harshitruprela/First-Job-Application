It was a monolithic application for job seekers and later, I migrated it to a microservice application using Spring Boot and
other tools.

I have applied different tools necessary for setting up microservices and also learned and integrated service registry methodology
using Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka. Also, an integrated distributed tracing tool, namely Zipkin, is used for monitoring and
logging all API requests in the backend. Later, containerized the application using Docker.

Tech Used: Java, Spring Boot, Maven, Hibernate, Docker, PostgreSQL, Netflix Eureka, Zipkin, Postman.
